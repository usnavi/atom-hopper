This is an example of how we might use spock to enumerate our specifications & QE tests.

This is just a start, so please provide feedback in how this can be better constructed.

To start you off, take a look at the following files:

pom.xml - contains the profiles & necessary inputs for running against our atomhopper servers in
          staging (stage-env) and test (test-env).

src/test/groovy/tests/RunTest - contains the sample test cases: a test which can get an arbitrary feed
                                and a test which posts to an arbitrary feed.

src/test/groovy/framework/AtomHopperTest - Base test class which extends spock's Specification class.
                                           Contains helper methods which get necessary auth token and makes
                                           http requests to the atomhopper server.

To run the tests:

cd to atom-hopper/spock
> mvn -P test-env clean test

If you get any SSL errors, you might need to import the SSL certificates into the cacerts of your JVM.  Shinta
